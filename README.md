Deep Neural Network Based Drink-Ordering Chatbot With A Web Application 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is how human intelligence was stimulated in machines and computer programs. AI chatbots are computer programs trained to make decisions like human beings. Chatbot technologies have taken a big step while ChatGPT came out last year. Developed rapidly in different versions in a few months, it satisfies many customers with high quality and fast response. They have been used widely in various fields such as health, ecommerce, education, and etc. In the dining industry, restaurant chatbot is one of the top innovative chatbot types among the mentioned fields, utilizing deep learning technologies such as transformers, Seq2seq. Restaurants expect the chatbot to perform high productivity in general inquiries while customers are able to shorten the waiting time making orders. Often, food and drink ordering in restaurants is a time-consuming task because a human waiter or waitress needs to spend a certain time on getting each customer's preference and giving customer-specific recommendations.This project has used and tested the accuracy of those deep learning algorithms on restaurant chatbots. The highest accuracy achieved was 98.4%.
